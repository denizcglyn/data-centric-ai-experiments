## 1. Bounding box tool
For example there are crossed lines(in the pastel color) after clicking on the bounding boxes icon that allows the users to locate their objects more accurately and more cropped
in a way that does not include the unnecessary background picture parts, thus more clear data refining in the date labelling process.

## 2. Keyboard shortcuts
They have created some keyboard shortcuts in the tool but I guess its not that special to create those although they are kind of must to be there.

## 3.  Super annotate 
They have a feature called "Supper annotate" that applies an enhanced annotation for the objects, it gets the object class automatically and applies the annotation best possible way
although, we might have to define extra data annotation points to include some part of the missing parts, pixels, etc.

## 4. Polygon
Polygon features for the objects with three or more straight sides by defining the boundaires of the objects (for object detection and semantic segmentation)

## 5. Instance ids object tracking
Instance ids and object tracking between images, adding attributes

## 6. Adding attributes

## 7. Image manipulation 
Very useful especially if the data sets contain dark images, etc

## 8. Adding classification tags
Adding extra tags to classify the image more comprehensively

## 9. Sub annotations: Annotations on top of annotations
